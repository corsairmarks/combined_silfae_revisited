[h1]Overview[/h1]
Have you seen the enviro-suited intensity of Silfae's "Animated Quarian Portraits" mod?  Do you wish that the gameplay elements were up-to-date so that you can play the Migrant Fleet or make a new species of interstellar wanderers?  Then this mod is for you!

There are lots of other mods which contain the same or similar portraits, so why should you choose this one? Silfae's art style meshes well with Stellaris, or maybe you want to play her version of the Migrant Fleet - content which this mod again makes playable.  Please enjoy my translation of Silfae's custom empire into modern Stellaris.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
All gameplay features from the original mod are upgraded to be fully compatible with Stellaris 3.8 "Gemini," the latest version when this was written.  Updates include:
[list]
[*]Fix invalid texture reference in [b]quarian_female_01_portrait.mesh[/b] (caused lots of error logs)
[*]Improve Quarian clothing selectors to be influenced by Pop job
[*]Update the namelist to account for all built-in army types, remove obsolete entries; Army names more lore-friendly
[*]Update custom starting initializer
    [list]
    [*]Original version with a habitable planet
    [*]New version that works with the Void Dwellers origin (available for any Void Dwellers)
    [/list]
[*]Add custom trait "Wanderers" that is a higher-powered version of Nomadic: +30% growth from immigration, -50% resettlement cost, +50% pop automatic resettlement chance
[*]Replace original "Quarian" trait with "Immunocompromised" that gives +5% engineering research, -5% habitability (0 points) - available for any species (AI will not use it)
[*]Update pre-scripted empire
    [list]
    [*]Now has oligarchic authority to reflect Quarian government style
    [*]Now has Origin: Void Dwellers (requires Federations)
    [*]Species traits altered: Void Dwellers, Wanderers, Intelligent, Immunocompromised, Nonadaptive, Deviants (selected based on the effects of Silfae's original design)
    [*]Starting leader begins with three traits: Home in the Sky, Space Miner, and Fleet Organizer
    [*]Can randomly spawn
    [/list]
[*]You can use the Quarian portraits for your own empire without any DLC requirements
[*]The Quarians are part of the Humanoid species class (since Stellaris 3.8)
[*]Support being able to choose a single-gender species (since Stellaris 3.2)
[/list]
[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
In order to add a new solar system initializer that is compatible with Void Dwellers, it is necessary to override [b]origin_void_dwellers[/b] add it to the list of allowed initializers.  That means this mod is incompatible with other mods that modify that origin definition, such as other mods that add new initializers for Void Dwellers.

Compatible with any other mod that does not add the same portraits or art assets.

The Launcher will tell you that some mods are outdated - that is because the dependency is out of date with the game's version number.  This mod overwrites and replaces all incompatible code so that the portrait mod will function as originally designed.  You can safely ignore the out-of-date warning for the dependency mod.

Built for Stellaris version 3.8 "Gemini."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]Dependencies[/h3]
In order for this mod to function, you [b]must[/b] install the following mod and load it before this one:

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=708669421]Animated Quarian Portraits[/url] by Silfae

[h3]Recommended Companion Mods[/h3]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2531002116]Migratory Fleet[/url] if you want to play as an actual fleet instead of using habitats. I am not involved with the development of this mod, however it is very impressive what the author achieved within the limits of Stellaris.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod should be added before the game has started.  If you remove it from a game in progress, your game may have graphical problems if any species was using the custom portraits.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
Silfae's original mod does not include graphics for ecumenopoleis, so they will fall back to the Mammalian graphical culture. If anyone knows of a mod that provides said stage-6 city picture, I would be happy to investigate getting permission to reuse the graphics, or add it as a dependency to this one.

This mod overrides [b]origin_void_dwellers[/b] in order to add its new initializer to the allowed list, which generates an error like this:
[code]
[23:27:16][game_singleobjectdatabase.h:165]: Object with key: origin_void_dwellers already exists, using the one at  file: common/governments/civics/05_quarian_revisited_origin_overrides.txt line: 2

[h1]Special Thanks[/h1]
I was inspired to extend the original mod when I saw [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037630876/myworkshopfiles/]Endugu[/url]'s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1584824947]expansion[/url] of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021525667/myworkshopfiles/]Silfae[/url]'s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=881118424]Animated Xirmian Portraits[/url].  Modular mods that require downloading the original mod(s) help give credit where credit is due.

An extra special thanks to Silfae for creating and sharing so many detailed, animated portraits for the community.
