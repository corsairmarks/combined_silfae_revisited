[h1]Overview[/h1]

Do you like space-elves? Perhaps even from a certain grimdark IP? Silfae's "Animated Eldar Portraits" mod fits the bill, but unfortunately the custom empire and starting system are no longer functional due to changes in Stellaris.  With this mod, now you can play as Ulthwé Craftworld using the special Eye of Terror system initializer as Silfae designed it (portraits and starting system available for use with custom empires).

There are lots of other mods which contain these portraits, so why should you choose this one?  None of the others update the custom solar system initializer or address the "Eldar leaders die quickly" issue, but this one does!  Please enjoy my translation of Silfae's custom empire into modern Stellaris.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

All gameplay features from the original mod are upgraded to be fully compatible with Stellaris 3.0.*, the latest version when this was written.  Updates include:

[list]
[*]Enhance clothing selectors to be influenced by Pop job
[*]Update the namelist to account for all built-in army types, remove obsolete entries
[*]Add custom trait "Ældari Longevity" to the Eldar species class
    [list]
    [*]This trait makes their leaders begin at an older age (previously this effect was from species class itself)
    [*]Add bonus lifespan to compensate for their older starting age
    [*]Automatically given to any species designed with the Eldar portraits
    [/list]
[*]Update prescripted empire for 3.0
    [list]
    [*]Now has Origin: Remnants (requires Ancient Relics)
    [*]Can randomly spawn
    [*]Gains Psionic Theory for free
    [*]Ulthwé names and colors are a somewhat more lore-friendly
    [/list]
[*]Rebuilt challenge-start custom solar system initializer for 3.0:
    [list]
    [*]Setup to work correctly for all origins/civics in unmodded Stellaris that do not restrict the starting system initializers (i.e. Origin: Shattered Ring or Origin: Void Dwellers)
    [*]Rebuild district and building creation and Pop generation
    [*]Any empire using this initializer gains Hydroponics Farming ([b]tech_hydroponics[/b]) and Weather Control Systems ([b]tech_housing_1[/b]) for free
    [*]Add modified Origin: Remnants starting capital deposits for use with this initializer
    [*]The Eye of Terror is its own graphics entity with a Stellaris-flavored description and adds the negative effects of [i]both[/i] black holes and pulsars
    [/list]
	[*]You can use the Eldar portraits and/or custom initializer for your own empire without any DLC requirements
[*]Fix the file type on the incuded event image - it was a [b].png[/b] with the [b].dds[/b] extension - it is now distributed in the correct [b].dds[/b] format for Stellaris (not in use... yet)
[/list]

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Compatible with any mod that does not add the same portraits, species class, or art assets.

May conflict with other mods that need to alter how relic worlds are upgraded.

The Launcher will tell you that some mods are outdated - that is because the dependencies are both out of date with the game's version number.  This mod overwrites and replaces all incompatible code so that the portrait mod will function as originally designed.  You can safely ignore the out-of-date warning for the dependency mods.

Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]Dependencies[/h3]

In order for this mod to function, you [b]must[/b] install the following mod and load it before this one:

[h3]When to Install[/h3]

This mod should be added before the game has started.  If you remove it from a game in progress, your game may have graphical problems if any species was using the custom portraits.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]

This mod preempts one event from the base game related to restoring relic worlds to ecumenopoleis ([b]mega.200[/b]).  Expect to see one line in error.log like this:

[code]
[16:33:48][eventmanager.cpp:355]: an event with id [mega.201] already exists!  file: events/megacorp_events.txt line: 190
[/code]

[h1]Special Thanks[/h1]

I was inspired to extend the original mod when I saw [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037630876/myworkshopfiles/]Endugu[/url]'s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1584824947]expansion[/url] of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021525667/myworkshopfiles/]Silfae[/url]'s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=881118424]Animated Xirmian Portraits[/url].  Modular mods that require downloading the original mod(s) help give credit where credit is due.

An extra special thanks to Silfae for creating and sharing so many detailed, animated portraits for the community.
