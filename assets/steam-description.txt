[h1]Overview[/h1]
Have you experienced the sleek, tentacled allure of Silfae's "Animated Octee-lan Portraits" mod? Do you wish that the gameplay elements were up-to-date so that you can play the Kuri-octa-Xibi and rebel against the Beep-Boops? Then this mod is for you!

There are other mods which contain the same portraits, so why should you choose this one? This mod fixes the old code so that the special starting system (containing your former machine overlords) is playable and ensures all the assets are usable by players. Please enjoy my adaptation of Silfae's custom empire into modern Stellaris.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
All gameplay features from the original mod are upgraded to be fully compatible with Stellaris 3.8 "Gemini," the latest version when this was written. Updates include:
[list]
[*]Remove duplication in room selector
[*]Remove alternate (blank) city graphics - mostly they were to try and get a static diplomacy backdrop but only worked for colonies with city size 4; set the [b]graphical_culture[/b] to not define a cityset
[*]Add a static room that looks identical to the original room plus backdrop image - this room is used by the predefined empire by default
[*]Original room (with see-through viewport) also remains available for use with custom empires
[*]Update the namelist to account for all built-in army types, remove obsolete entries
[*]Fix definitions for Octee-lan custom greeting sound
[*]Machine species (Beep-Boop) now uses the default robot sounds instead of (non-robotic) mammalian sounds
[*]Add gestalt version of the Alien Zoo (building, technology, and job) which is available to non-genocidal gestalt empires
[*]Update pre-scripted empire (Kuri-octa-Xibi):
    [list]
    [*]Octee-lan species
        [list]
        [*]Female mono-gender species (since Stellaris 3.2)
        [*]Swap Rapid Breeders to Aquatic (requires the Aquatic Species Pack) to fit the role-play better
        [*]Remove Communal because Charismatic is now 2 trait points now
        [/list]
    [*]Uses Origin: Syncretic Evolution (the Quoi-chi are the secondary species; requires Utopia)
    [*]Uses Aquatic cities and ships (requires the Aquatic Species Pack)
    [*]Can randomly spawn
    [/list]
[*]Update custom starting initializer (Tsukimi Pool):
    [list]
    [*]Now supports a variety of civics and origin starts (all the built-in ones)
    [*]Muubul species: add Natural Engineers because they had an extra trait point
    [*]Yuibitt species: add Aquatic and Slow Learners to use all available trait points
    [*]Xueench species: add Quick Learners because they had an extra trait point
    [*]Your former overlords, the Beep Boops, will spawn if the Synthetic Dawn DLC is active
    [*]Beep-Boop species: removed High Maintenance, add Efficient Processors so that all points are spent
    [*]Beep-Boop empire: now a regular empire, with a special exception allowing them to have a colony in the same system (in order to fight you)
    [*]The Beep-Boops begin with a starbase above their planet, or an orbital ring if the Overlord DLC is active
    [*]You cannot close your borders to the Beep-Boops, nor can they close theirs to you
    [*]Beep-Boops will hate you for rejecting them
    [/list]
[*]The Octee-lan are part of the Aquatic species class (if you own the Aquatics Species Pack) or Molluscoid species class (if you don't) (since Stellaris 3.8)
[*]The Beep-Boop portrait (there is only one) is part of the Machine and Robot species classes, meaning you can use it for your own amchine empire or as alternate robot portraits (since Stellaris 3.8)
[*]You can use the Octee-lan portraits for your own empires without any DLC requirements as well as the robotic Beep-Boops (the machine version requires Synthetic Dawn)
[/list]
[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
This mod overrides two diplomatic actions (Close Borders and Declare Rivalry) in order to prevent players beginning in Tsukimi Pool from closing their borders to the Beep-Boops (which would otherwise cause their fleets to be stuck permanently MIA). That means this mod is not compatible with others that make changes to the same diplomatic actions (but does not conflict with mods that add extra diplomatic message text). Otherwise compatible with any other mod that does not add the same portraits, species class, or art assets.

The Launcher will tell you that some mods are outdated - that is because the dependency is out of date with the game's version number. This mod overwrites and replaces all incompatible code so that the portrait mod will function as originally designed. You can safely ignore the out-of-date warning for the dependency mod.

Built for Stellaris version 3.8 "Gemini." Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]Event Preemption[/h3]
In order to allow the Beep-Boops to have a planet in the same system as the player, this mod replaces the event [b]action.85[/b] that is responsible for (on a monthly basis) transferring control of any colonies not owned by the system's starbase's owner to the starbase owner. The Beep-Boops have a special exception, otherwise this event continues to function as normal.

[h3]Dependencies[/h3]
In order for this mod to function, you [b]must[/b] install the following mod and load it before this one:

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod should be added before the game has started. If you remove it from a game in progress, your game may have graphical problems if any species was using the custom portraits.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
This mod preempts one event and overrides two diplomatic actions, which generates three lines in the error log like this:
[code]

[h1]Special Thanks[/h1]
I was inspired to extend the original mod when I saw [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037630876/myworkshopfiles/]Endugu[/url]'s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1584824947]expansion[/url] of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021525667/myworkshopfiles/]Silfae[/url]'s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=881118424]Animated Xirmian Portraits[/url]. Modular mods that require downloading the original mod(s) help give credit where credit is due.

An extra special thanks to Silfae for creating and sharing so many detailed, animated portraits for the community.
