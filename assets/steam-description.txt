[h1]Overview[/h1]
This mod is a compilation of my adaptations of Silfae's portrait mods.  Please see the description of each individual mod for what the effects are.

Individual mods update first, then changes are merged here.

[h1]Bundled Mods[/h1]
This is a bundle of mods to make it a little easier to sub and ensure cross-compatibility with each-other.  Please check each individual mod for the effects and any known issues.  The numbers indicate which version of a particular mod is contained in this mod (which also corresponds to the version tag in its [b]git[/b] repository).

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Requires Stellaris 3.6 "Orion" and disables achievements.

Check each of the contained mods for an explicit list of incompatibility notes.  Notably some Pop jobs (13 for the Holofrixits) are overridden.  These job overrides help Pops with Holofrixit caste traits be attracted to jobs for which they are well-suited.  If overridden by another mod, the job(s) in question will no longer attract Holofrixits based on their caste role, which could lead to some Pops working jobs they are less-suited for (primarily military-related jobs for normal empires, or "complex" drone jobs for gestalts).
