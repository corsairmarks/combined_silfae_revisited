[h1]Overview[/h1]

This mod is a compilation of my adaptations of Silfae's portrait mods.  Please see the description of each individual mod for what the effects are.

Individual mods update first, then changes are merged here.

[h1]Bundled Mods[/h1]

This is a bundle of mods to make it a little easier to sub.  Please check each individual mod for the effects and any known issues.  The large hex strings are the commit hashes - that is mostly for my own record-keeping to know what revision of the other source code is contained here.
