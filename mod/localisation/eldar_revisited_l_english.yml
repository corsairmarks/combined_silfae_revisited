 # prescripted empire
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eldarcraft1: "Ulthwé Craftworld"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eldarcraft1_desc: "The Eldar are an ancient alien race whose vast empire once expanded the width and breadth of the known galaxy. Their empire was without equal, and they counted themselves masters of the stars. But millennia ago, their overweening pride and their fall into hedonistic practices led to a cataclysm that all but eradicated their kind and led to the birth of the Chaos God Slaanesh. Despite their boundless power, the heart of their civilisation was torn out by this catastrophe of their own making, forcing the surviving Eldar to flee upon gigantic starships called Craftworlds. Now they cling to survival by a thread, fighting the horrors of the galaxy with ritualised discipline and consummate skill. Though highly advanced and feared across the galaxy, the Eldar are a dying race - a shadow of their former glory - their race teeters on the brink of annihilation."

 pc_silfae_eye_of_terror_desc: "A massive tear through space-time inside which any separation between realspace and the Shroud has been erased. It pulls fiercely at its own edges, prising more of realspace into itself with the inexorable grasp of a black hole. Within it, objects absorbed from realspace are continuously twisted and reshaped by the malevolent, fickle whims of whichever Shroud entity currently dominates the region. Others gather to attempt forcing their true forms through into realspace. None have fully succeeded... yet."
