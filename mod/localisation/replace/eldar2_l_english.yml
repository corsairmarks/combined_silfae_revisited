 eldar_system_NAME: "Ulthwé"
 eldar_system_DESC: "§LUlthwé was caught in the gravitational pull of the Eye of Terror when it formed during the birth of Slaanesh. The craftworld now orbits it, perilously close to ultimate absorption and under regular attack from the denizens of the Eye of Terror. Being so near the Eye, the craftworld has fought long and bitterly against Chaos forces. Areas within the craftworld lie in ruins from battles fought within Ulthwé itself between Eldar and Chaos raiders.\n\n§R- WARNING: Challenging Home System§!\n- No system resources\nSize 6 homeworld, but no district blockers\n- No guaranteed habitable worlds will spawn near your home system§!\n\n$system_initializer_DESC$"
