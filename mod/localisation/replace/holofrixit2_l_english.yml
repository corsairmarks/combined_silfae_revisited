United under the Xechiros, the free-thinking administrative caste, they have quickly overrun the desolate, arctic plains of their homeworld, greedily feeding on electrical discharges pouring from the power plants of their predecessors.\n\nWith the resources of their homeworld depleted, the rulers of the Holosphere started to turn their gaze to the stars. Able to phase in and out of a virtual reality of their own making, the Holofrixits have started to create holographic starfleets, plugging their conciousness in their servers and projecting themselves into space..."

 holocrisis.2102.desc: "A Synthetic work detail on [Root.GetName] was recently discovered to have been diverting building material to construct some sort of small, unarmed spacecraft in an abandoned hangar. The vessel was half-finished when it was found.\n\nAll of the Synths involved in its construction were immediately dismantled so that their memory cores could be thoroughly analyzed, but they appear to have self-wiped just before the units went offline - something their manufacturer assures us should be impossible."

 holocrisis.2202.a: "This project may be critical to our survival."
 holocrisis.2203.desc: "After much experimentation, our scientists have managed to devise an effective detection method for identifying Synthetic infiltrators disguised as [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nScanners are being distributed to our security forces, and several Synth cells have already been exposed and destroyed.

 holocrisis.2205.desc: "The Spaceport orbiting [Root.GetName] has been scuttled! We are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but it appears that several members of its command staff, including the chief engineer, had been replaced by Synthetic infiltrators.\n\nBetween them the Synths must have managed to obtain the Spaceport's self-destruct codes. Most of the station's crew managed to evacuate to the surface of [Root.GetName] before it was destroyed, but the losses in both material and property are substantial."
 holocrisis.2205.a: "How could this have happened?"
 holocrisis.2206.name: "Fear and Suspicion"
 holocrisis.2206.desc: "A large portion of the population on [Root.GetName] has been gripped by fear and paranoia as a result of the recent Synthetic infiltrations. Our citizens are accusing their neighbors, co-workers and even family members of being Synth impostors.\n\nThere have been several lynchings of individuals that were wrongfully accused of being Synths.

 holocrisis.2209.desc: "A Synthetic assassin has killed [ruler.GetRegnalName]! It had somehow managed to assume the identity of a member of our ruler's personal bodyguard.\n\nThe severed body parts of [ruler.GetRegnalName] were found meticulously arranged in a pattern identical to the symbol used by the artificial intelligences - no doubt in a calculated effort to cause further harm to the morale of our citizens.
