 trait_silicoid: "Silicoid"
 trait_silicoid_desc: "§LSilicoids are a subtype of lithoids and require £minerals£ §Y$minerals$§! to maintain their bodies, but also require organic compounds in the form of £food£ §Y$food$§!. Unlike their lithoid relatives, silicoids tend to exhibit distinct genders, reproduce at a pace more similar to carbon-based life, and are more sensitive to changes in environment.§!\n"
 trait_melting: "Molten"
 trait_electroid: "Electroid"
 trait_electroid_desc: "§LMembers of this species, rather than requiring a mineral intake like most silicoids, have evolved to naturally attract and consume electricity to sustain their bodies in addition to regular food.§!\n"
 TRAIT_ELECTROID_EFFECT: "Pops consume £energy£ §Y$energy$§! instead of £minerals£ §Y$minerals$§!.\n"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1: "Taclariotan Influence"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1_desc: "The ephemeral inhabitants of Taclaarat have a long history of tribalistic warfare and technological competition. Taclariota are big and lean silicoids with a glassy look and sharp features. They are cautious and untrusting around other species, often perceived as rough and imperfect when compared to their crystalline structure.\n\nDespite their tribalistic competition, individual Taclariota understand perfectly the need for cooperation and are happy to obey their superiors, working together against their enemies.\n\nHaving unified only in the last century, the Taclariotan species has undergone a series of political and racial purges via brutal terraforming of their own continental masses. They have finally found peace under the iron grip of a technocratic royal line."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire2: "Mandate of Druerd"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire2_desc: "Having evolved as an outgrowth of their very homeworld, Gogrods have maintained a religious connection with their planet for their entire history.\n\nBound in a symbiotic relationship with the land as well as each other, these silicoid life forms have naturally coalesced into a single planetary government as they multiplied and acquired full sentience."
