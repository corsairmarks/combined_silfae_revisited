 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1: "Taclariotan Influence"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1_desc: "The ephemeral inhabitants of Taclaarat have a long history of tribalistic warfare and technological competition.\n\nTaclariota are big and lean silicoid with a glassy look and sharp features. They are cautious and untrustworthy around other species, often perceived as rough and imperfect when compared to their crystalline structure.\n\nDespite their tribalistic competition, individual Taclariota understand perfectly the need for cooperation and are happy to obey their superiors, working together against their enemies.\n\nHaving been unified only in the last century, the Taclariotan species has undergone a series of political and racial purges via brutal terraforming of their own continental masses, finally finding peace under the iron grip of a technocratic royal line."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire2_desc: "Having evolved as an outgrowth of their very homeworld, Gogrods have maintained a religious connection with their planet for their entire history.\n\nBound in a symbiotic relationship with the land as well as each other, these silicoid life forms have naturally coalesced into a single planetary government as they multiplied and acquired full sentience."
