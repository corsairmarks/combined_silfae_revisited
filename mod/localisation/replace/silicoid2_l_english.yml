 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1: "Taclariotan Influence"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1_desc: "The ephemeral inhabitants of Taclaarat have a long history of tribalistic warfare and technological competition. Taclariota are big and lean silicoids with a glassy look and sharp features. They are cautious and untrusting around other species, often perceived as rough and imperfect when compared to their crystalline structure.\n\nDespite their tribalistic competition, individual Taclariota understand perfectly the need for cooperation and are happy to obey their superiors, working together against their enemies.\n\nHaving unified only in the last century, the Taclariotan species has undergone a series of political and racial purges via brutal terraforming of their own continental masses. They have finally found peace under the iron grip of a technocratic royal line."
