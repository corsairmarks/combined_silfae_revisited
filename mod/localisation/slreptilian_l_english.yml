 EMPIRE_DESIGN_slreptilian1:0 "Global Earth Order"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_slreptilian1_desc:0 "The myriad Human nations that constitute their interstellar government are disparate, yet united in purpose. These bipedal mammalians have developed a society that encourages and even thrives on individual freedoms and cultural differences - as a result, Humans tend to integrate well with alien populations. \n\n Yet, under the illusion of freedom, all these nations are secretly ruled by a global network of reptilian overlords, exploiting and manipulating the human population since untold time. \n\n These cold, deceitful creatures compensate their small numbers with ruthless cunning and camaleontic abilities. For centuries they've used a mix of natural skills, interbreeding and genetic engineering to masquerade their agents and infiltrate them in human communities, carefully and gently controlling their unaware slaves.\n\n Earth has grown small for the leaders of the hidden global oligarchy, and so their last elected leader, the Illuminated Tetran, has decided to allow warp technology to be discovered. \n\n As human puppet leaders prepare themselves to build their first interstellar fleet and set forth in the great unknown vastity of space, little do they know that their actions are but a small step in a much greater and older plan that is well beyond their understanding."
 START_SCREEN_SLREPTILIANS:0 "Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Their kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nScientific progress has been swift, though not without cost. Wars claimed millions of lives even before the atom was tamed, and the turmoil of the 21st century saw the mandate of the United Nations gradually expanded in an effort to create stability. By the early 22nd century the supranational organization had been accepted as a de facto world government. A bothersome but necessary move as the real global government of the Elders manipulates the human proles of all the nations of Terra to pool their resources and efforts in order to enact their plans for interstellar domination. \n\n As the gullible bald apes toil to build their spaceships, dreaming of a new era of discovery and exploration, our thinblood agents look over them, and those amongst us who are Illuminated carefully prepare for the next step of a plan that was thousands of years in the making."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CONCEALED_GOVERNMENT:0 "Though we were far from the only sentient species on our homeworld, nor were we the most proliferous, we had other ways to make up for our lack in numbers. \n\n Far before our biological cousins managed to evolve past their primitive, meaningless existence, we managed to assert our control over them, subtly and slowly. As centuries passed, we managed to rewrite the history of our slaves and hide ourselves from them, leading them forward with a firm but gentle touch."
 civic_shadowy_evolution:0 "Parasitic Evolution" 
 civic_shadowy_evolution_desc:0 "This species has adapted to survive by leeching off the work and skills of other species. Its members control other sentient beings through various means, manipulating them from the shadows. This allows them to keep their slave pops happy and unaware. The more the main species grows in numbers though, the harder it is to keep up the charade."

 slreptilian_illusion_10:0 "The Great Illusion: Cracking"
 slreptilian_illusion_10_desc:0 "We are losing control over our slaves. Not only more and more of our servants are discovering and rejecting our control, but the excessive proliferation of our kind has made it much more difficult to control and our own people and hide our presence to the public. We must distance ourselves from the slaves and allow them to repopulate before we can mend the holes in our network." 
 slreptilian_illusion_0:0 "The Great Illusion: Awakening"
 slreptilian_illusion_0_desc:0 "The slaves are awakening! Our numbers have grown too large to keep our nature hidden anymore. The servants are discontent and rioting, our own agents are either breaking off and forsaking our cause, or are unable to fulfill their tasks due to lack of slaves. If we don't acquire more servants or greatly reduce our numbers, we put at risk not only the complete unraveling of the Great Illusion but our very survival."
